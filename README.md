The goal of it is to make monthly predictions out of some energy production data from windmills. It is actually unfinished but it is the most complete demonstration of what I can achieve in C++. The content is in Spanish and it is very inconvenient to translate it all, and I would do some things differently now. But please notice:

- Proper organization of the project in a directory tree structure and use of Makefile.
- Use of templates and lambda expressions.
- Understanding of headers, modularization and OOP.
- Use of basic algorithms, code design and clean code.
